# Are You Ready to Invest?

1. Monitoring your spending and saving could help ensure that you are able to pursue several objectives at once like saving while paying down debt.
2. Paying down high interest debts as quickly as possible can help you free up money to save.
3. Save what you can now and increase your level of saving over time in order to meet your goals.
4. Your time frame for investing is a major consideration when choosing an appropriate asset allocation along with risk toleration and your financial situation.
5. Asset allocation refers to the amount of stocks, bonds, and short-term, or cash, investments in your mix.
6. The opportunity cost associated with not investing may be high if you’re shooting for a long term goal-like retirement.
7. Your personal situation, including your risk tolerance, risk capacity, time frame, and financial needs, will drive nearly all of your investment decisions.
8. Risk toleranace and risk capacity are two sides of the same coin. Investors need to invest in a way that aligns with both of them.
9. Don’t wait to invest - take advantage of do-it-for-me solutions until you feel comfortable with DIY investing. If you never plan to be a DIY-investor, that’s great, too - there are plenty of options that will keep you invested with professional management at a low cost.
