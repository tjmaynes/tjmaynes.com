# Tour of Duty

> This originally came from Shyam Vala towards the end of tour at NBCUniversal.

Under the "laissez-faire" agreement, employees are encourages to think of themselves as "free agents", looking to other companies for opportunities for growth and changing jobs whenever better ones beckon.

It's better to encourage entreprenuerial behavior, don't treat your employees like children. The new compact acknowledges the probable importance of the relationship yet seeks to build trust and investment anyway.

Loyalty =/= benefits of alliance

As allies, employer and employee try to add value to each other. "If you help me grown and flourish, I will help the company grow and flourish."
