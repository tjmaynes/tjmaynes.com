# Sidecar

The sidecar pattern is a single node pattern that splits infrastructure logic from application logic. With containers, youâ€™d have your application logic living in one container, while the other container is used to add functionality to improve the existing application. Sidecar containers are deployed next to an application container on the same local machine. Modularity and reuse of components are another important aspect of the sidecar pattern.
