# Test-Driven Development

## Getting Started

### **“Walking Skeleton” phase**

* Automating the build, test and deploy pipeline of an application running in CI
* This bubbles up uncertainties very quickly.
* No big design upfront required, just the smallest set of acceptance tests that gives us the early feedback we are looking for.
* Find the simplest path first

### **Start Each Feature with an Acceptance Test**

* Turning acceptance tests from red to green gives us feedback on the progress we are making with a feature
* Start with the simplest success case first
