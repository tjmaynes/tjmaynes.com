# Pickle Principle



Simply asking “why” in the beginning of the engagement can have a positive effect on the team, helping them to become aware of the blind spots that may have developed as a result of pickling.

We don’t want to come in and make unreasonable demands; we want to work with a client team to challenge and overcome the aspects of their context that may be holding them back from high performance.

Employees may get so adjusted to a set of circumstances that change no longer feels like an option.

The challenge is how to get the client in long, continued contact with some kind of brine, without the consultant even being present
