# Agile Software Development

According to [Pivotal Labs](https://pivotal.io/agile), agile software development is a set of methods that result in fast and frequent delivery of value to customers. It promotes well-planned, small iterations by highly collaborative cross-functional teams. However, to accomplish this "business must be culturally ready for the change and committed to coaching/training."

To implement agile software development, teams plan, design, test, build, accept and deploy changes to their customers through iterations, rapidly. The culture promotes transparency \(through standups, retrospectives, etc\), flexibility \(items in backlog are prioritized when requirements change\), predictability \(work is prioritized and time-boxed to sprints lasting 1-2 week cycles\), and focusing on business value \("what value are we working on for the customer?"\).

Value is derived from the business and users, each feature delivers incremental value and quality is improved as a result of being able to locate and fix issues more easily and rapidly through test-driven development.
