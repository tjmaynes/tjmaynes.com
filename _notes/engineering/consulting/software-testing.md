# Software Testing

## Techniques

#### E2E

* An end-to-end test both the system and the process by which it’s built and deployed. An end-to-end test interacts with the system only from the outside: through its user interface, by sending messages as if from a third-party system, by invoking its web services, by parsing reports, and so on.

#### UI/Acceptance

* Tests that prove a feature works as expected for the end user. Tests that check the functionality we want to build. Does the whole system work? The role of acceptance testing is to write end-to-end tests.

#### Integration

* Testing that many units \(or components\) work together as a whole. Does our code work against code that we can’t change? Tests that check how some of our code works with code from outside the team that we can’t change.

#### Unit

* Do our objects do the right thing, are they convenient to work with?

#### Endurance

#### Stress

* 
#### Load

* A load test is a planned test to perform a specific number of requests to a system in order to test the functionality of the system under specific levels of simultaneous requests.

#### Snapshot

* Requires human interaction since a machine can’t determine if the change was intended. Version control and PRs allows others to confirm the change was intended.
