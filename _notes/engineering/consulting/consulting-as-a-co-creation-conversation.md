# Consulting as a Co-Creation Conversation

It’s okay to let a team get burned a bit, if the choice is between that and imposing your opinions as the wielder of power.

If the team decides upon a solution which you think is incorrect, and you’ve already voiced your opinions enough—let the team try something else.  If it goes sideways, code is changeable and easier to fix than a fraught client relationship. Either way, the client, the one who will be the one maintaining the product well after you leave, will have a complete understanding of why decisions were made each step of the way. They’ll have made a decision, faced consequences, iterated, and pivoted. That’s empowerment. That’s active learning. That’s the opposite of being a passive receptacle for your database ideas.

Be humble. Give up control. Listen. Step back.
