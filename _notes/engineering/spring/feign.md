# Spring Cloud OpenFeign

## Notes
- [Spring Cloud OpenFeign](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-openfeign) is a declarative web service client. Feign allows developers to create a webservice client for their spring app.  Feign allows downstream consumers to quickly integration with an upstream web service by providing developers with a generated web service-specific http client.
