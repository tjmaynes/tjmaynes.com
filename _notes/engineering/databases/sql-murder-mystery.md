# SQL Murder Mystery

Normally when learning a new programming language, library, or concept, I'll fire up an editor and write a set of tests to drive out the knowledge that I am seeking. For a while now, I've wanted to learn more SQL but haven't made time to do so. Luckily this [game](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21799988), called SQL Murder Mystery, showed up on Hackernews one cold winter morning.

[SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) utilizes your SQL querying abilities to solve a "whodunnit" murder mystery with only a single clue to start from. To solve these problems you'll need to write SQLite queries, which I have some decent CRUD knowledge of, as it is the SQL language of choice for the game. I had a lot of fun playing this game and wish more games like this were created for developers.

Below are the SQLite queries I used to solve the Murder Mystery game.

### Solutions

#### Find Report query

```text
select
  crime_scene_report.description
from crime_scene_report
where
  date = 20180115
  and city = "SQL City"
  and type = "murder"
```

_Results_:

#### Find Morty Query

```text
select
  person.name,
  interview.transcript
from person
inner join drivers_license on person.license_id=drivers_license.id
inner join interview on person.id=interview.person_id
where person.address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr"
order by person.address_number desc
limit 1
```

| Morty Schapiro | I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W". |

#### Annabel query

```text
select
  person.name,
  interview.transcript
from person
inner join drivers_license on person.license_id=drivers_license.id
inner join interview on person.id=interview.person_id
inner join get_fit_now_member on person.id=get_fit_now_member.person_id
where person.name like "Annabel%" and person.address_street_name = "Franklin Ave"
```

select 
  person.name,

from get_fit_now_check_in
inner join get_fit_now_member on get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id=get_fit_now_member.id
inner join person on get_fit_now_member.person_id=person.id
inner join drivers_license on drivers_license.id=person.license_id
inner join interview on interview.person_id=person.id
where
  get_fit_now_check_in.check_in_date = 20180109
  and get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id like "%48Z%"
  and drivers_license.plate_number like "%H42W%"
order by get_fit_now_check_in.check_in_time desc
```
