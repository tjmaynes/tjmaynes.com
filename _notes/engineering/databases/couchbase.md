# Couchbase

Couchbase server is specialized to provide low-latency data management for large-scale interactivity web, mobile, and IoT applications. Common requirements that Couchbase Server was designed to satisfy include:

* Flexible data model
* Powerful query language
* Scalability
* Performance
* Simple Administration
* High Availability

Couchbase documents are JSON based.

Couchbase can be queried using N1QL, a SQL dialect for queuing, transforming, and manipulating JSON data.

Couchbase supports JOIN operations

Couchbase was designed to process online operational data-heavy read and write traffic for modern applications.

Couchbase is a memory-centric system that keeps frequently accessed documents, metadata, and indices in RAM.

Couchbase uses an object managed cache, bts is a distributed hash table with full memcached capabilities.

Replication and sharing are fundamental features of Couchbase Server.

It automatically distributes data across nodes in a cluster.

Thus being able to achieve high availability via horizontal scaling.

It achieves high hardware efficiency by employing async, non-blocking I/O at all levels for effective utilization of server resources.

Couchbaseâ€™s architecture ensures that workloads are evenly distributed across cluster nodes, reducing bottlenecks and allowing users to take full advantage of available hardware.

The entire cluster is managed through a single admin console that offers single-click cluster expansion and rebalance.

Built with a strong emphasis on reliability, high availability and simple management.

Can safely update nodes in a cluster without taking down the system or replicated the service in another environment.

XDCR addresses the unique challenges inherent in linking clusters that span across a wide-area network \(WAN\).
