*This post is an unordered list of reasons why I enjoy using Emacs.*

# Emacs Lisp
Emacs uses a dialect of Lisp called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp">elisp</a> which is quite powerful for making small (or large) scripts to customize emacs working environment. Also, in my opinion its important as a developer to learn a little Lisp and understand just how incredible the language is/can be. It's quite beautiful that a text editor can be configured to what you want/desire by using a language that many programmers are familiar with.

# Org-mode
<a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> is my favorite way to get work completed and also efficient enough to record some thoughts from my mind. I've used Evernote and then switched to OneNote (which was an excellent experience). I use org-mode for jotting down things I learn from the internet, my weekly schedule, writing small stories, keeping my notes organized, etc. I also use git to sync my org files with a remote server.

# EMMS
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/">EMMS</a> stands for *Emacs MultiMedia System* which I use primarily for internet radio and listening to local (or remote) music directories. I can't say much more about EMMS than that its really neat that my text editor allows me to play music (so no need for spotify, itunes, etc).

# Doc-view mode
I have found <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Document-View.html">doc-view-mode</a> to be a life saver from constantly having to look back and forth between code and text. Although my only complaint is that I can't really use doc-view-mode for large pdf files (>10mb), which will cause Emacs to hang and *possibly* crash.

# M-x package-list-packages
I think a real draw of emacs is having the ability to download emacs packages (emms, cider/slime, org-mode, python-mode, etc) from within emacs. Also, all the packages I use are found (organized) in my emacs.d folder in my home directory, which is nice since I dont have to search very far if I need to modify or manually delete a package.

# Conclusion
<img src="/img/why_emacs.png">
Although, Emacs did take a little bit to get used to, it ultimately paid off in the long run. I don't want to end this post thinking that I purely only use emacs (especially since I use vim when I'm working from a remote server). Emacs is highly extensible (and free) and I love it. I hope that everyone enjoyed this post! Please email me if I have made any mistakes in this post!
