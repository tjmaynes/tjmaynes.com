# Introduction
The goal of this blog post is to show you how to build a complex navigation flow using SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a relatively new UI framework officially supported by Apple. Prior to SwiftUI, teams would have to choose three different ways to build their iOS screens:
1. Using Nibs (aka interface builder)
1. Using Storyboards
1. or programmatically.


## Scenarios

### Push to view with navigation link

### Pop back to view using presentation mode via Environment annotation

### Show modal and navigate to next view

## Conclusion
